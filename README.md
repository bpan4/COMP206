## Course Objectives
COMP-206 is a 3-credit full semester course in Software Development under the UNIX environment. It is offered in both the fall and winter semesters and is a required course for students in many of our degree programs.  It provides a comprehensive introduction to and overview of the C programming language and how to use it with the UNIX environment to build software. 
This course focuses on System Application Development, which relates to the integration of differing software,programming languages and environments into a single application.  In this light the course also teaches programming in Bash, interfacing with the operating system and interfacing with networking.
COMP 206 sets the stage for follow-on courses COMP-273, COMP-307 and COMP-310, plus others.This course also gives the student basic Software Management skills in the form of the GNU tool set and Common Code Management techniques

## Course Description
Comprehensive overview of programming in C, use of system calls and libraries, debugging and testing of code; use of development tools like make and version control systems.

## Evaluation
 - Assignments 28%
 - 6 Mini-Assignments (Mini 1-5 4% each, Mini 6 is 8%)
 - 1 Online test 10%
 - Final Exam 62%

You may use your final exam to replace you class test grades (72 %).The final exam will cover the entire course.

###### Grading: 
All software solutions must compile with zero errors and must run to be graded. It does not need to run correctly for grading, but it must run. If your program compiles with errors or does not run at all then you will receive zero points. The grader will not fix your code or look at the source code to give you partial grades.

###### Late work: 
You will be notified in advance of assignment due dates. All assignments are due on My Courses at the indicated time and date. Late assignments will lose 5% ofits grade per day late. Assignments beyond 2 days late will not be accepted. You may not submit assignments via e-mail without the permission from the instructor.

###### Additional Work:
Students with grades of D, F or J will not be given the opportunity to complete additional work to upgrade their grade. 

###### Supplemental Exam: 
Check with the university for this opportunity.

###### Re-grading: 
Mistakes can occur when grading. Not surprisingly, requests for re-grading always involve those mistakes in which the student received fewer points than they deserved, rather than more points than they deserved. With that in mind: if you wish me to re-grade a question on an exam or assignment, I will do so. I reserve the right to re-grade other questions as well.

###### Cheating/Collaboration: 
Collaboration is encouraged but your discussions should be public in the sense that anyone including the professor should be allowed to listen in. Assignments are original works created by the student alone. You are permitted and encouraged to haveconversations with other students concerning the contents of the assignments and how to do them, but your work must be original.  If two or more assignments are found to be identical (or portions of assignments) then all parties will lose points.  This includes the student who permitted their assignment to be copied.  This includes written solutions and software source code. The students will be reported to the university plagiarism department.

## Communication

###### My Courses: 
All official communication, including announcements, lecture material, assignments, grades will be found on My Courses.

###### Course Discussions:
The online free tool, piazza.com, is used as our course discussion board. Please make sure to enroll in the Fall 2020COMP 206 course on Piazza. Use this as your primary communication medium, since your questions are public and can help other students.

###### Course Email: 
This is best for direct communication. Both the TA and professor use this account. Expect a reply in 24 hours or less. Use this email account for questions you do not want other students to see. 

###### Private Email:
The professor and TA have private email accounts that you may also use, however these communication channels are for personal queries. For example: if you have a problem with your grade then email the TA who graded you directly, do not email the prof and do not use the course email address.
